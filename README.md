# AnnaCats

Practicing my CSS and JavaScript by building a cat gallery app thing for my friend Anna. Who is fond of cats, naturally.

## To do:

- [ ] Make responsive! Cos it ain't currently :(
- [x] Add images to a favourites gallery
- [ ] Style the gallery so it doesn't look shit
- [ ] Save the gallery to local storage
- [ ] Retrieve gallery from local storage (if one exists)
- [ ] Have a way to delete images from gallery
- [ ] Avoid adding duplicate images to gallery
- [ ] Some form of gallery modal?
